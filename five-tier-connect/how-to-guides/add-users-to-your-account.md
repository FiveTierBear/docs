   * Click 'Send Invitation' or a similar button to email the invitation to the new user.
6. **User Acceptance**:
   * The user will receive an email with an invitation to join the Five Tier Connect account.
   * They must follow the instructions in the email to set up their account and confirm their email address.
7. **Confirmation and Follow-Up**:
   * Once the new user has accepted the invitation and completed their setup, you will receive a notification.
   * Check in with the new user to confirm they have access to the necessary parts of the platform.

**Best Practices**

* Verify the email address of the user before sending an invitation to prevent access issues.
* Communicate with the user to inform them of the pending invitation and their role within the platform.
* Regularly review user access levels and permissions to maintain security and effective management of your Five Tier Connect account.
