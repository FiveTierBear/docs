# Geolocation Targeting

Geolocation Targeting uses location data to deliver relevant advertising to consumers based on their current or past locations. This technology allows for hyper-localized marketing efforts, connecting with customers when and where it's most effective.

By targeting users within a specific geographic area, we can drive foot traffic, promote local events, and increase regional sales. Our platform's advanced geolocation capabilities ensure that our clients' messages are timely and contextually relevant, leading to higher engagement rates and a stronger local presence.
