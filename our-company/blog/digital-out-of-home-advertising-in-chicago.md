# Digital Out of Home Advertising in Chicago

When it comes to getting your brand’s message out and seen in the Windy City, one of the most effective options is digital out of home (DOOH) advertising in Chicago. DOOH campaigns combine impactful visuals, strategic placement and customization to ensure that you are reaching your target audience in Chicago.

DOOH advertising provides businesses with a way to reach their potential customers with messaging that is memorable and has long-term impact. As part of a comprehensive brand identity, DOOH advertisements can quickly target potential customers with localized, eye-catching visuals. And while digital marketing is considered a mainstay, DOOH marketing allows companies to communicate with people outside of the scope of their digital media.

When considering a DOOH advertising strategy in Chicago, it’s important to understand the key performance metrics and how they can positively benefit your business. Measurement metrics for DOOH ads range from tracking impressions based on a variety of factors, such as circulation, to tracking “lift” in sales and other metrics. Engagement metrics also measure audience interaction with DOOH ads, such as whether someone actively engages with a ad, visits a website based on the ad, or clicks on the ad.
