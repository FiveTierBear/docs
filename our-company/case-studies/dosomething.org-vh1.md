# DoSomething.org / VH1

File Under: Non-Profit, Cause Marketing, Lead Generation, Awareness

It was a late-Friday afternoon when the phone rang.  It was the cable network VH1, who had recently announced their partnership and commitment to air the DoSomething.org awards.  “The awards are two weeks away” we heard, “and we are low in audience participation - what can you do to help?”

Using the metric that if we received 10,000 additional votes as part of our effort we would need to receive a minimum of 40,000 additional visits to the vote registration page which meant we would have to reach between 600,000-800,000 people - we developed a cross-channel plan with a heavy influencer marketing component.

### The Five Tier Difference

Through the technology that exists in Five Tier, we were able to:&#x20;

* Quickly identify key metrics, and costs to achieve those metrics
* Develop a communication strategy that would resonate with our target audience
* Implement recruitment, monitoring, and measurement tools for the program

### Results

In less than ten days and in advance of the award show we hit our goal and the program was a success.  We far surpassed our goal by obtaining millions of impressions, 100,000+ additional site visits, and over 18,000 votes.  Furthermore we developed a network of influencers in these key markets, an asset for the client to use in future programs.&#x20;
