# G/O Media - A Success!

G/O Media's campaign was a triumph in strategic timing and targeted messaging. During the pivotal media planning season spanning the end of 2019 and early 2020, we focused our efforts on the bustling New York and Chicago markets, specifically during peak commuting times to ensure the highest impact.

The campaign's effectiveness was immediately apparent, with the microsite garnering an average of over 100 direct visits daily, complemented by more than 20 text inquiries. The precision of Five Tier's platform allowed us to trace each visit and lead back to the exact moment and location of the ad's appearance. Additionally, the agility of our platform facilitated seamless and instant creative updates.

The numbers tell the story of our success: 77,000 ad plays at an efficient $13.75 CPM, a reach of 10.9 million impressions across 5 integrated channels, and an exceptional 78% in added value. This is the Five Tier impactâ€”efficiency, precision, and results.
