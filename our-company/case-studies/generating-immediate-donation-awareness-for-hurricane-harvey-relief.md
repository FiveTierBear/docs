# Generating immediate donation awareness for Hurricane Harvey Relief

Hurricane Harvey devastated the gulf coast of the United States just before Labor Day weekend in 2017. The need for a quick relief effort, including donations to support those efforts, were paramount. Five Tier’s functionality and direct access network for media placements allowed for the quick re-formatting of campaign creative, approval, and instant placement on one of the most visible, historic media placements - Times Square Billboards.

**The Process**

In partnership with The Ad Council, campaign creative was modified within Five Tier to fit the unique specs of the Times Square placement. Upon client approval, creative was instantly trafficked via direct integration and live on the Billboard within minutes, on next refresh, becoming the first mass campaign to take advantage of full functionality and instant placement capabilities of Five Tier’s technology, service, and network features.

**Results**&#x20;

Over 1 Million unique impressions were generated over the week after Harvey hit, increasing campaign awareness of how and where to donate.
