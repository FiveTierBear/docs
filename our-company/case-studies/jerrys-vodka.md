# Jerry's Vodka

File Under: Retail, Sales Generation, Branding

JERRY’s Vodka is a local New Jersey craft/artisanal vodka started in 2016. When the founders of JERRY’s Vodka first approached Five Tier as a very small client, the company was just an idea on a napkin. The challenge the company had was that they were a small brand that nobody had ever heard of before, and needed help with their launch.

Within 24 hours of the founders briefing the team on what they were looking to do, we built a brand that resonated with the target market, a website, and social media materials - all using Five Tier technology. Overnight, the company became an instant, buyable brand.

**Programs Utilized:**

* Connected Media

### Results

Three years later, JERRY’s Vodka has become a million dollar business that is sold in over 150 locations throughout the state of New Jersey. Five Tier continues to work with JERRY’s Vodka to build the trajectory of the company in the years to come.
