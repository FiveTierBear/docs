# Jerry's Vodka

Launching a new brand into the crowded spirits market is a formidable task, especially for an artisanal vodka brand from New Jersey. When the creators of JERRY's Vodka came to us with nothing more than a concept, we had the exciting challenge of turning their vision into a tangible, marketable reality.

With a swift 24-hour turnaround, leveraging Five Tier's cutting-edge technology, we crafted a brand identity that clicked with consumers, developed a sleek website, and created compelling social media content that positioned JERRY's Vodka not just as a product, but as a lifestyle choice.

Our strategy encompassed connected media, automated creative content, strategic influencer partnerships, and dynamic email and social media campaigns.

The outcome? JERRY's Vodka skyrocketed from a mere idea to a million-dollar business in three years, now boasting presence in over 150 retail locations across New Jersey. Our journey with JERRY's continues as we steer its growth trajectory onwards and upwards.
