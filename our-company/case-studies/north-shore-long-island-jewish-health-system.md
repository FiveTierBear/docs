Marketing a network of hospitals is tricky.  The relationship within a hospital is typically with the physician, unless it is an emergency in which case proximity is normally the highest priority.  So how do you shift the thought process to align with a hospital network versus a specific physician, and brand a hospital network when the need doesnâ€™t exist so that when it does an educated decision takes place versus a reactionary decision?

We crafted a communication strategy that focused on four key areas, or products, within the hospital - Cardiovascular, Cancer, Neurosurgery, and Pediatrics.  We then strategically placed media based on consumer behavior paths, displaying our message only when they had the highest probability of receiving a message.  Furthermore, we did not focus on engagement, we stopped communication at education, so that our focus was on branding a cognitive thought process that built a bond with the hospital network.

### The Five Tier Difference

Through the methodologies that exist in Five Tier, we were able to:&#x20;

* Identify media opportunities that resulted in highly targeted placements
* Focus our communication strategy on the highest value message at the most opportunistic time
* arget our audience in areas that were receptive and understood the importance of preventative care

### Results

The network boosted brand recall by 43% and obtained an +80s dwell rate for advertisements, far exceeding industry standards.  Furthermore, people put the hospital network first, associating a higher value of care with the physicians that practiced at their facilities, which completely flipped the relationship consumers have with physicians and hospitals.
