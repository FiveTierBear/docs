# North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System

Building a connection with a hospital network over individual physicians presents a unique challenge, especially when emergencies often dictate immediate choices based on proximity. The goal is to foster a relationship with the hospital network so that when needs arise, the choice of hospital is a deliberate, informed one rather than a hasty decision.

To achieve this, we developed a strategic communication plan focusing on North Shore LIJ's key services: Cardiovascular, Cancer, Neurosurgery, and Pediatrics. Our approach was to intertwine our messaging within consumer behavior patterns, ensuring that our brand's presence was felt at the most impactful moments. Rather than pushing for immediate engagement, we concentrated on planting seeds of awareness, cultivating a mental association with the North Shore LIJ network.

Our strategy at Five Tier utilized precise media targeting, timing our message to coincide with moments of maximum receptivity, and prioritizing educational content over direct engagement to build a lasting brand relationship.

The results spoke volumes: a 43% increase in brand recall and an impressive 80-second dwell time on our ads, shattering industry norms. Most importantly, we reshaped the public's perception, positioning the North Shore LIJ network as the epitome of quality care, thereby revolutionizing the dynamic between patients, hospitals, and physicians.
