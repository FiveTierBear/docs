# Five Tier Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Experience

Five Tier has a wealth of Pharmaceutical and Healthcare experience for companies that include Genentech, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, and North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System (NSLIJ, now Northwell Health.)

In almost every instance, the programs followed the standard path of identifying pockets of ripe targets, then placing creative tailored to the individual, and attributing success through soft metrics like click-throughs as well as hard metrics like appointment bookings.

**Genentech Need:**&#x20;

Education and Awareness with physicians and potential patients. Calls, web visits, conversions / appointments, and specific med requests from patients to physicians.&#x20;

**The Five Tier Difference:**

For Genentech, we started first with market awareness around the drugs Herceptin and Supprelin. These programs placed 70% weight on broad marketing to doctor offices in target markets that raised awareness of the drug. The remaining 30% of the programs were targeted towards potential patients who showed behaviors consistent with a need for treatment, encouraging them to ask for the drug by name.&#x20;

**Genentech Result:**&#x20;

When patients went in for an exam and a treatment was to be prescribed the patient asked for the drug by name - a name the doctor was familiar with based on the broadcast marketing to offices - and the treatment was prescribed or information requested for future patients both increasing consumption and softening the sales cycle for company reps.
