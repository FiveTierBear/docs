# STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK (SUNY)

File Under: Higher Education, Awareness, Lead Generation, Conversion Winter in Plattsburgh, NY is cold, and it's nearly in Canada.&#x20;

So it is no surprise that it is difficult to get a seventeen or eighteen year old high school student to give the local university a glance and that doing so would take some convincing. However, we did more than just get those students to take a glance. SUNY Plattsburgh approached us to help them correct a three year decline in applications and, subsequently, accepted offers for admissions. After all, you have to have enough applications in order to have a pool of people accepting offers, right?

**The Five Tier Difference**&#x20;

Using the Five Tier methodology, we identified a key audience opportunity in a region close to 200 miles from the university. Using market monitoring and the University's existing databases we were able to hone in on key stories from individuals that attended the University from this market, then tell their story again and again to prospective applicants. Through advanced media mix modeling we reached prospects with the right message at the time they were most likely to be receptive, achieving our goal of increasing applications. As a follow-up, only for those accepted, we implemented a targeted followup campaign that continued to build the bond which increased the rate of acceptance because, after all, an applicant and offer only solves a portion of the problem but it doesnâ€™t result in tuition revenue for the University.

**Results**&#x20;

After a three year decline, in year one we rebounded university applications and admissions to the levels they were at prior to the decline. In year two we continued this trend, spiking applications by an additional +18%. The best part? We saw potential applicants, applicants, and admitted students actively talking about the program and acknowledging the retargeting effort as being key to their acceptance of the University's admission offer.
