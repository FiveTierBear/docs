# State University of New York

Convincing high school seniors to consider a university nearly touching Canadian borders, especially during the chilly winters of Plattsburgh, NY, is no small feat. Yet, that's exactly what SUNY Plattsburgh needed after a worrying three-year dip in applications and acceptances.

We tackled this challenge head-on. We pinpointed a crucial audience nearly 200 miles away and dove deep into market insights and the university's data. By spotlighting relatable success stories from alumni in that region, we crafted a narrative that resonated with prospective students, implementing a media strategy tailored to catch their attention when they were most open to new ideas.

Our efforts didn't stop at applications. We launched a personalized follow-up campaign for those admitted, fortifying the connection with SUNY Plattsburgh and transforming offers into actual enrollments â€” because that's where true success lies for any educational institution.

The outcome was a resounding success: not only did we reverse the downward trend, but we also lifted applications by 18% in the second year. The real reward, however, was hearing students themselves attribute their decision to accept SUNY Plattsburgh's offer to our strategic retargeting campaigns.
