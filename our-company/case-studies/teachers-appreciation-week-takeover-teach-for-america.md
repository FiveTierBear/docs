# Teacher’s Appreciation Week Takeover Teach For America

\
During Teacher's Appreciation Week, Teach For America executed an unparalleled programmatic media blitz with Five Tier's expertise. From May 3-7, 2021, the campaign became a national event, leveraging out of home advertising, connected TV, and a robust PR strategy—all orchestrated via our Connected Media platform, Five Tier Connect. Teach For America amplified this with their own social media and email efforts.

This ambitious campaign spanned six days, lighting up billboards and TV screens nationwide, including a stunning takeover of Times Square's digital canvas with two major billboard displays and eight screens in total. It touched 51 markets across six regions, with 205 highway billboards capturing over 630,000 impressions and targeted connected TV ads garnering an additional 35,000 impressions. The Times Square showcase alone amassed over 1 million impressions in just three days.

Complementing this reach, the PR Newswire press release potentially impacted an astonishing 91 million more impressions. The creative dynamism was unmatched, with roughly 24 unique creative templates in 15 sizes, resulting in 360 distinct creative executions across multiple platforms. The Teach For America Teacher’s Appreciation Week Takeover wasn't just a campaign; it was a celebration broadcasted on an epic scale.
