# The Children's Place

File Under: Retail, Sales Generation, Advocacy

The Children’s Place is a North American specialty retailer of children’s apparel and accessories, with over 1,000 stores and a notable e-commerce experience. The challenge the company faced was unifying its presence across the various channels through which its customers interact. They first approached us to enhance their social media experience in order to better engage its current fan base and acquire new ones.

We conducted research into the market and competitive landscapes in order to create a compelling and effective strategy. From there we created and developed a facebook page and digital strategy, utilizing elements of commonality between the company’s retail store and website. Through our design, interactive development, and social media management, we grew their advocate base to over 1 million actively engaged customers, resulting in a 30% spike in sales. The strategy and end result was so successful, that The Children’s Place was recognized by Mashable for “Best Brand Use of Facebook.”

### Results

As a result of this success, our relationship with The Children’s Place grew to include additional components of their digital strategy, such as designing and implementing online promotions.
