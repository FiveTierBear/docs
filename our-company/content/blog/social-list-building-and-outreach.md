# Social List Building and Outreach

**Overview**\
You can use Five Tier Connect to build both B2C and B2B lists that pull directly into our customer relationship management (CRM) tool. Once lists are imported, use our integrated email blaster and text messaging tool to communicate with contacts. The notes and classification features lets you manage cohorts of contacts easily, and all of this is done in one convenient place!\
