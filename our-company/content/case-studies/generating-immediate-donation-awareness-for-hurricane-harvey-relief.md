# Generating immediate donation awareness for Hurricane Harvey Relief

In the wake of Hurricane Harvey's destruction in 2017, an immediate response was crucial to aid relief efforts. We rose to the occasion by launching the world's first "Instant Placement" campaign for Hurricane Harvey Relief on the iconic Times Square Billboards.

Our seamless process involved a swift adaptation of The Ad Council's campaign creatives to meet the specifications of Times Square's digital canvas. With rapid client approval, we utilized our direct network integrations to broadcast the message in real time. This marked a historic moment as the campaign went live within minutes of the next screen refresh, showcasing the swift and powerful capabilities of Five Tier's technology and services.

The impact was profound – over a million unique impressions in just one week post-Harvey, significantly boosting awareness and directing the flow of donations to where they were needed most.
