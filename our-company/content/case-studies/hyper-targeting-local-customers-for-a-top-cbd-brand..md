# Hyper Targeting Local Customers for a Top CBD Brand.

Hot Coffey, an innovative Oklahoma-based digital marketing firm, excels in web design, development, SEO, and branding, predominantly serving clients across the southern United States.

Faced with the challenge of amplifying market share and in-store traffic for a premier CBD product, Hot Coffey partnered with Five Tier to deploy a finely-tuned OTT marketing campaign throughout North Texas during Q2 of 2019. This multifaceted campaign was disseminated across streaming services, mobiles, tablets, desktops, and connected TVs, underpinned by our strategic geofencing of 26 select retail outlets to monitor the influx of customers influenced by the video adverts.

The collaboration delivered remarkable results, with over 650 verified in-store visits directly attributed to the campaign, effectively surpassing anticipated targets and optimizing the client's budget by delivering measurable, cost-effective outcomes.
