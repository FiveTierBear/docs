# Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Experience

We bring a substantial track record in the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare sector, having worked with industry giants like Genentech, Novartis, Johnson & Johnson, and North Shore LIJ (now Northwell Health). Our approach typically involves identifying highly specific target demographics, crafting personalized creative content, and measuring success through both engagement metrics and concrete outcomes such as scheduled appointments.

With Genentech, our task was to elevate the profile of medications like Herceptin and Supprelin, not just among potential patients but within the medical community. We focused 70% of our efforts on broad marketing directed at doctors' offices to increase the drugs' visibility. The rest was aimed at potential patients, nudging them to request these drugs by name.

This dual approach led to tangible results: patients began asking for these medications during consultations, leveraging the prior brand familiarity we had built among physicians. This not only spiked drug adoption rates but also streamlined the sales process for Genentech's representatives.
