# The Jarlsberg Tasting Room

The Jarlsberg Tasting Room campaign was a revolutionary blend of the physical and digital realms, designed to create a seamless experience that transitioned smoothly from online to offline engagement. In collaboration with Digital Surgeons, we brought to life a concept that was as innovative as it was ambitious—a "living billboard" in Times Square that not only advertised but also interacted in real-time with the tasting room.

To stir curiosity and facilitate immediate action, we disseminated information about the tasting room through an integrated network of screens located in supermarkets, a critical touchpoint for spur-of-the-moment decisions. The campaign was amplified through event listings, social media buzz, and the energetic presence of street teams.

The billboard itself went beyond passive advertising, it became a dynamic reservation system, guiding cheese enthusiasts to the tasting room with updates sent directly to their phones. Upon arrival, guests were ushered into an exclusive experience via a mobile app that rewarded them with special offers post-visit.

At the tasting room, guests indulged in complimentary Jarlsberg cheese paired with wine, enhancing their brand education and enticing future purchases with a coupon incentive. Post-event, the experience was shared widely on social media and celebrated on the very billboard that first invited guests in, creating a perfect cyclical journey from ad to action.

The Jarlsberg Tasting Room epitomizes the power of connected media—a campaign that garnered over 10 million impressions, engaged thousands, and brought over 500 people to live tastings, driving brand interaction and sales in an unprecedented fashion.
